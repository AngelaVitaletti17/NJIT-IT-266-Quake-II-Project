# NJIT-IT-266-Quake-II-Project
First Quake II Project

As of 04/10/17 I HEAVILY messed up my repository and had to roll back to my very first inital commit. From here, I have uploaded
the correct files that you would need for the mod. The comments are god awful, but uh... Yeah.

Timeline:
04/10/17 - Milestone checkpoint completed
04/10/17, 11:48 PM: For those looking to make the Mod work, a the output directory of the visual 
                    studio sln file has to be set to whatever you named the folder.***
05/08/17 - Project Completed. Although I missed one thing, it works pretty well. I do want to make
           something VERY clear though. I did use tutorials to help me with this from places like
           ModDB and QDevels. I give appropriate credit where credit is due! I couldn't have done
           it without those wonderful people.
